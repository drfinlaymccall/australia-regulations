# Australian Commonwealth legislative instruments

Part of [lexifina/global-law](https://github.com/lexifina/global-law), one git history for every country's law: this is Australia's federal legislative instruments, which global-law reads at `australia/federal/instruments/`.

The regulations, determinations and ASIC instruments that sit under the
Commonwealth statute book, as a git history: **one commit per amending
instrument, on the day it took effect**.

That makes two questions cheap which are otherwise slow:

```bash
# What has ever changed this provision, and when?
git log --date=short --format='%ad  %s' \
  -- corpus/foreign-acquisitions-and-takeovers-regulation-2015/s-052.md

# What did the whole instrument say on the day a deal signed?
git checkout foreign-acquisitions-and-takeovers-regulation-2015/2023-07-01
```

The corpus is built for **M&A diligence**, where the Australian-side
instruments — foreign investment screening, merger notification, takeover
relief — are the ones most often missed, and where the question is
usually not "what does this say?" but "what did this say in March, and
who changed it since?".

It is laid out to match [`lexifina/global-law`](https://github.com/lexifina/global-law),
and is intended to sit in that tree as `australia/federal/instruments`.

## What is in it

See [`corpus.json`](corpus.json) for the machine-readable record of
coverage, and [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md) for the counts and the
verification result.

## Using it from an AI model (MCP)

`tools/mcp_server.py` is a Model Context Protocol server for this corpus.
It makes the two questions above into tools, so Claude or any other MCP
client can read a provision as it stood on a date and say which
instrument last changed it. Python 3.11+ and git, standard library only,
over stdio. It reads this clone and makes no network calls.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drfinlaymccall/australia-regulations
cd australia-regulations
claude mcp add au-instruments -- python3 -I tools/mcp_server.py
```

For other MCP clients, add this to their settings:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "au-instruments": { "command": "python3",
  "args": ["-I", "/path/to/australia-regulations/tools/mcp_server.py"] } } }
```

Four read-only tools -- `provision_on_date`, `instrument_on_date`,
`what_changed`, `find_in_law` -- and then plain words:

- "What was the combined acquirer/target revenue test on 1 January 2026,
  and which instrument set that figure?"
- "What has changed in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation
  since 1 July 2023?"
- "Show me the short-form notification the ACCC requires."
- "Will the Takeover Bids Instrument still exist in October 2029?"

Every answer names the compilation it was read from. Where the record is
weaker than the answer looks -- a date before that instrument's
`no_gaps_from`, or a compilation much older than the date asked about --
the answer carries a `caveats` list that says so, rather than reading as
though the record were continuous.

The server defaults to the repository it sits in. Set
`AU_INSTRUMENTS_CORPUS` to read a different clone or build.

A worked application of this corpus is the
[australian-deal-review](https://github.com/drfinlaymccall/australian-deal-review)
plugin, which puts these tools behind the Australian checks on an M&A
transaction. The corpus does not depend on it.

## Layout

```
corpus/<instrument-slug>/
    intro.md            name, authorising provision, preamble
    s-052.md            section 52
    r-6.10.01.md        regulation 6.10.01
    sch-1/cl-01.md      Schedule 1, clause 1
    part-6/div-2.md     a Division that holds law text directly
```

Most law sits in a provision file. Some does not: a Part, Division or
Schedule can carry text with no provision heading beneath it, and the
notification forms in the merger determinations are whole Divisions
written that way. That text is filed under the containers that hold it,
so the ACCC short-form notification is
`competition-and-consumer-notification-of-acquisitions-forms-determination-2025/part-6/div-2.md`.

Inside a file: `##` lines for the Part and Division headings that open
at that provision, a `#` line with the provision number and heading,
then one line per paragraph. A table row is one line, cells separated
by ` | `.

A plain section number is zero-padded to three digits (`s-052.md`) so
sections sort in numerical order. Numbers that are already compound keep
the form the instrument writes, so that the file name is the citation:
the modern Commonwealth style `s-1-9.md` for section 1-9, and
`r-6.10.01.md` for regulation 6.10.01.

## Reading the history

Every commit is one amending instrument taking effect:

```
Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment (UK Free Trade Agreement) Regulations 2022

In-force: 2023-05-31
Compilation: 17
Compilation-id: F2023C00520
Affecting: intro.md
Affecting: s-005.md
Affecting: s-079.md
Kind: Amend
Amending-provisions: sch 1 (items 1, 2)
```

The commit is **authored by the amending instrument**, not by a person,
so `git log --author` and `git shortlog` work on instruments. Its date
is noon in Canberra on the day the change took effect. Each compilation
is tagged `<instrument-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.

Where the Register attributes a compilation to more than one instrument,
the commit is authored `Federal Register of Legislation` and carries an
`Attribution:` trailer naming what it could not be narrowed to. Nothing
is guessed.

`main` holds only what is in force today. Compilations with a future
start date are on the `future` branch.

Every instrument here sunsets, and a sunsetting repeal has no compiled
text -- the Register records the version with no document at all -- so
the repeal is committed on `future` as the removal of the instrument,
with `Kind: Repeal`:

```bash
# Will the Forms Determination still exist at the longstop date?
git log --format='%ad %s' --date=short future \
  -- corpus/competition-and-consumer-notification-of-acquisitions-forms-determination-2025
```

## Building it

```bash
python3 tools/fetch_all.py                      # download, 10s between requests
python3 tools/build.py   --today 2026-10-31     # parse and replay into git
python3 tools/verify.py  --today 2026-10-31     # check against the official text
python3 tools/completeness.py --today 2026-10-31 # check against the official contents
```

No dependencies beyond the Python 3.11+ standard library. The fetcher
waits at least ten seconds between requests, as the Register's
robots.txt asks, and never re-fetches anything already cached. The build
and the verifier never touch the network at all.

**Do not point `fetch_all.py` at the whole Register.** It covers a named
list of instruments. The Register asks to be contacted before a full
crawl, and that request is worth honouring.

## Is it right?

Two checks, which fail in different ways.

`tools/verify.py` reads every compilation back out of git and compares
it word for word with the Register's own Word document, through a second
extractor written a different way from the one the build uses, so a bug
in the build shows up as a mismatch rather than being reproduced
identically on both sides. The release bar is zero mismatches.

That is not enough on its own. Both extractors drop the same things --
the contents, the page furniture, the endnotes -- so neither can report
a provision that both of them skipped: the comparison comes back clean
and the provision is simply absent. `tools/completeness.py` checks that
against the one part of the document the build never reads. The
compilation's own table of contents names every provision it holds, so
any number listed there whose text is nowhere in the tree is a gap. (A
Schedule written as a flat run of numbered items is filed as one file
for the whole Schedule, so the check looks for the item there before
calling it missing.) That check exists because this build had such a
gap: about five hundred paragraphs of the ACCC's prescribed notification
forms, which are whole Divisions of law written with no section heading
beneath them, and the word-for-word comparison was clean the whole time
they were missing.

[REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md) carries both results, the counts and the
software versions.

Builds are deterministic: the same cache and the same `--today` give
the same commit hashes.
